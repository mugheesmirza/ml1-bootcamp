# ml1-bootcamp

## Introduction
This bootcamp is about the Data science. Where we started from the basics of python and explored some of the libraries used in the Image Processign and Data science including openCV, numpy, pandas and then in term of visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn and finally we explored libraries like tensorflow and Scikit learn to dive into the realm of machine learning. After Machine Learning basics we dived into Deep learning. We also had a look of GANs and their internal implimentations. We also had a look at Natural Language Processing, and how the chatbots work and finally how we can impliment RAG as well as vector stores.
